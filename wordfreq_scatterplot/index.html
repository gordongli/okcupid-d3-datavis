<h2>Data Processing</h2>
<p>The data for this scatterplot was calculated from essay0 (“my self-summary”) in the original dataset. R and its libraries for text analysis were used to combine submissions from male and female profiles into a corpus for each gender. Each corpus was cleaned (of punctuation, stopwords such as ‘I’, ‘am’, etc.) and the words were stemmed (so ‘dance’, ‘dancer’, and ‘dancing’ would all be counted with their stem ‘danc’) before creating their document term matrix. A word-frequency data frame for men and women was made from this and inner joined on the words into a table. This table was then exported and edited in Excel to obtain each gender's frequency rate (total number of times word was used in [gender] profiles / total number of [gender] profiles) along with a ratio between these rates. This table was then imported to Tableau for prototyping, where frequency rates below 1% were filtered out for the final data to be used in the D3 visualization. You may view the

</p>

<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>We see in this visualization the rates at which people use words in their essay response to the “my self-summary” prompt. For example, some of the most highly used words are ‘love’, ‘like’, and ‘life’. We can also compare rates of usage between the genders. For example, while women are more likely to describe themselves with adjectives like independent, silly, sweet, and warm, men are more likely to describe themselves as cool, company, and laid(-back?). We can also find differences in verbs and nouns: notable ones include dance, dog, yoga, sing, dress, and garden for females in contrast to sport, build, science, snowboard, guitar, and computer for males. </p>
