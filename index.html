<h2>Project Dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A data set consisting of user profile data for 59,946 San Francisco OkCupid users (a free online dating website) from June 2012. Each row represents the data for one user profile, and columns include user information and lifestyle variables such as sex, sexual orientation, age, ethnicity, education, income, and religion, along with text responses to the 10 essay questions such as “My Self Summary”. <a href="https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid" target="_blank">The original dataset</a> was processed for essay text analysis, but <a href="https://github.com/rudeboybert/okcupiddata" target="_blank">a smaller, cleaner version</a> was used for the other visualizations. </p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I chose this dataset because the possibility of quantifying dating in the digital world is interesting to me. I had seen some intriguing data visualizations on the OkCupid blog in the past, and was pleased to discover this dataset so that I too may try to discover some insights from it. The dataset is also sampled from San Francisco, so it may be of particular relevance to the students at the USF taking the Data Visualization course for which this project is being done. I hope to learn from this dataset of dating profile data some interesting things about human society, culture, and psychology, especially with regard to differences in gender.</p>
